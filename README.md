# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate for WooCommerce

A fork of the [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate), which was written by [Tom McFarlin](http://twitter.com/tommcfarlin/), passed on to [Devin Vinson](http://devinvinson.com/contact/), and enhanced by [Josh Eaton](https://twitter.com/jjeaton), [Ulrich Pogson](https://twitter.com/grapplerulrich), and [Brad Vincent](https://twitter.com/themergency).

This fork adds a new tab with two sections to the WooCommerce Settings page. For further information, visit [the tutorial](https://medium.com/@paulmiller3000/how-to-extend-woocommerce-with-the-wordpress-plugin-boilerplate-adac178b5a9b).

## Contents

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `README.md`. The file that youâ€™re currently reading.
* A `auspost-shipping` directory that contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Credits

90% of this code was developed by the following people:

* [Tom McFarlin](http://twitter.com/tommcfarlin/)
* [Devin Vinson](http://devinvinson.com/contact/)
* [Josh Eaton](https://twitter.com/jjeaton)
* [Ulrich Pogson](https://twitter.com/grapplerulrich)

The general approach to adding a WooCommerce tab was inspired by [Beka Rice](http://bekarice.com/). StackOverflow answers and/or code samples from the following individuals helped with some stumbling blocks and best practices:

* [Slicktrick](https://stackexchange.com/users/3835188/slicktrick?tab=accounts)
* [Goran Jakovljevic](https://gist.github.com/goranefbl)

Any poor practices and mistakes are strictly of my own making.
